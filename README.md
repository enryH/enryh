### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Data Scientist at DTU biosustain (Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for biosustainability) (NNF CBMR) in Copenhagen. 

Nearly all of my work you can find currently under the github of [DTU biosustain](https://github.com/biosustain), the [Multi-Omics-Analytics-Group (MONA)](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group) and the [RasmussenLab](https://github.com/rasmussenlab). 

Currently I'm working on metabolomics and phosphoproteomics dataset in the context of engineering cell factories. I also worked on on self-supervised deep learning models for MS-based proteomics imputation. 
See the [PIMMS repository](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms) and the [Nature Communications paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48711-5). You might also be interested to checkout a comparison based on PIMMS on an Alzheimer dataset: [rasmussenlab.org/pimms](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/pimms/)

For an easy comparison of proteomics data and some clincial metadata, have a look at [not just another biomarker (njab)](https://njab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can easily run the example notebook on colab (which is regularly automatically tested to work) and plug-in your data. Having the associated python package will it make it easy to extend the experiments. The code was used in a [Nature Medicine paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01850-y) and a [Scientific Reports paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47384-2)

## Other Projects

- an easy to use [notes template](https://github.com/enryH/notes_template)
- [lab wesite for technical notes](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/notes/) (based on Sphinx, deployed via GitHub)
- [ProteoBench](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - focus on software parameter file parsing
  > ProteoBench is an open and collaborative platform for community-curated benchmarks for proteomics data analysis pipelines. Our goal is to allow a continuous, easy, and controlled comparison of proteomics data analysis workflows.
- creating and curating a [Python package template](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/python_package)
