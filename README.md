### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PostDoc at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (NNF CBMR) in Copenhagen. 

Nearly all of my work you can find currently under the [github of the RasmussenLab](https://github.com/rasmussenlab). 


Currently I'm working a lot on self-supervised deep learning models for MS-based proteomics imputation. 
See the [PIMMS repository](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms) and the [bioRxiv pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.12.523792v2). You might also be interested to checkout a comparison based on PIMMS on an Alzheimer dataset: [rasmussenlab.org/pimms](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/pimms/)

## Projects

- [lab wesite for technical notes](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/notes/) (based on Sphinx, deployed via GitHub)
- [ProteoBench](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - focus on software parameter file parsing
  > ProteoBench is an open and collaborative platform for community-curated benchmarks for proteomics data analysis pipelines. Our goal is to allow a continuous, easy, and controlled comparison of proteomics data analysis workflows.
- creating and curating a [Python package template](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/python_package)
