### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research (NNF CPR) in Copenhagen. 

Nearly all of my work you can find currently under the [github of the RasmussenLab](https://github.com/rasmussenlab). 


Currently I'm working a lot on self-supervised deep learning models for MS-based proteomics imputation. 
See the [PIMMS repository](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms) and the [bioRxiv pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.12.523792v2).

## Projects

- [lab wesite for technical notes](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/notes/) (based on Sphinx, deployed via GitHub)
