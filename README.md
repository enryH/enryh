### Hi there 👋

I am a Senior Data Scientist at DTU Biosustain (Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability) in Copenhagen. 

You can find nearly all of my work on GitHub under the organisations [DTU Biosustain](https://github.com/biosustain), 
the [Multi-Omics-Analytics-Group (MONA)](https://github.com/Multiomics-Analytics-Group), 
and [RasmussenLab](https://github.com/rasmussenlab). 

Currently, I'm working on metabolomics and phosphoproteomics datasets in the 
context of engineering cell factories. I also worked on self-supervised deep 
learning models for MS-based proteomics imputation. See the 
[PIMMS repository](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/pimms) and 
the [Nature Communications paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48711-5). 
You might also be interested in checking out a comparison based on PIMMS 
on an Alzheimer's dataset: [rasmussenlab.github.io/pimms/](https://rasmussenlab.github.io/pimms/)

For an easy comparison of proteomics data and some clinical metadata, have a look at 
[not just another biomarker (njab)](https://njab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can 
easily run the example notebook on Colab (which is regularly and automatically tested
 to work) and plug in your data. Having the associated Python package will make 
 it easy to extend the experiments. The code was used in a 
 [Nature Medicine paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01850-y) and a 
 [Scientific Reports paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47384-2).

## Other Projects

- An easy-to-use [notes template](https://github.com/enryH/notes_template)
- [Lab website for technical notes](https://www.rasmussenlab.org/notes/) (based on Sphinx, deployed via GitHub)
- [ProteoBench](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - focus on software parameter file parsing
  > ProteoBench is an open and collaborative platform for community-curated benchmarks for proteomics data analysis pipelines. Our goal is to allow a continuous, easy, and controlled comparison of proteomics data analysis workflows.
- Creating and curating a [Python package template](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/python_package)
